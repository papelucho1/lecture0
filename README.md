Hello!
this is a skull of a website where you could find recipe for salad, my main idea is to create an app where you could add more recipe, order and filter by kind of diet (Vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian or ominivore), filter by ingredientes or any new idea
most all the websites is made by Bootstrap, it makes the content more easer to distribute and to undertand better web design

files :
index.html -> here is the menu principal, with 4 image based by diet (Vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian or ominivore) and cliking its buttons gets you to the recipe of that salad. At end, the " See all recipes" button gets you to the website where is listed all the salad. this page is responsive (max-width: 575.98px).

omnivoreSalad.html pescatarianSalad.html, veganSalad.html, vegetarianSalad.html -> here is the content of the salad with the ingredients in a table without borders. At the top is the navbar where you could go wherever you want 

recipes.html -> the main idea of this site is to show all the recipe and filter by diet (Vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian or ominivore), it's responsive. it has 2 discribe list and 2 unordered list. 

style.scss-> inheritance creates the colors of the cards at index.html and recipe.html when it is responsive (max-width: 575.98px). the Filter at recipe.html is made by nesting.

stylesheet.css -> it has all the style added to the pages.

stylewithscss -> here is where the file scss is compiled 


img/ -> fold where the images of the index.html are saved

looking forward to read any feedback or comment, 
kind regards 
Felipe
