# Project 0

Hello!
This is a draft website where you could find salad recipes. My main idea is to create an app on which you could add recipes, filter by diet (i.e, Vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian or omnivore), filter by ingredients, or any new idea.

Most of the website utilizes Bootstrap, making the content easier to distribute and also to understand good web design

files :
index.html -> The main menu. 4 images are presented, one for each diet (Vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian or ominivore), and clicking its button gets you to the recipe of that salad. At bottom, the " See all recipes" button gets you to the website with all the listed salads. This is responsive page (max-width: 575.98px).

omnivoreSalad.html pescatarianSalad.html, veganSalad.html, vegetarianSalad.html -> Here is the content of the salad with the ingredients in a table without borders. At the top, is the navbar, on which you could go wherever you want 

recipes.html -> The main idea of this site is to show all the recipe and filter by diet (Vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian or omnivore), it's responsive. it has 2 discrive? list and 2 unordered list. 

style.scss-> By inheritance, the colors of the cards at index.html and recipe.html are set, according to the responsive breakpoint (max-width: 575.98px). The Filter at recipe.html is made by nesting.

stylesheet.css -> It aggregates all the pages styles.

stylewithscss -> Here is where the scss file is compiled 


img/ -> Directory where the images for index.html are stored

Looking forward to read any feedback or comment, 
Kind regards
